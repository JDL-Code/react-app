# react app for learning and experimenting with containers

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JDL-Code/react-app.git
```
## Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd react-app
```
## Install dependencies using npm

```bash
npm install
```
## Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application locally.

```bash
npm run start
```

This command runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Building for Production
To build the app for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```
This command builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
